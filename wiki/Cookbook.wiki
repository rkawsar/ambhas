= Copula =
Copula is a function to couple two CDFs. The library is called using
{{{
ambhas.copula
}}}
The library has three copulas namely Clayton, Frank and Gumbel.

{{{
# import the required libraries
import numpy as np
from ambhas.copula import Copula  
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# generate some pseudo observations
x = np.random.uniform(size=(100))
y = np.log(x) + 0.5*np.random.normal(size=(100))

# use the copula
foo = Copula(x, y, 'clayton')
foo.tau

# generate ensemble using copula
x1,y1 = foo.generate_xy()

# plot the ensemble along with observations
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4.5))
plt.scatter(x1,y1, color='g', label='Generated ensemble')  
plt.scatter(x,y, color='r', label='Observations')  
plt.xlabel('x')  
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.legend(loc='best')
plt.savefig('/home/tomer/svn/ambhas-wiki/images/copula.png')  

}}}

In the similar way 'frank' and 'gumbel' copula can also be used.

= csglm =
    CSGLM (Coupled Surface-Ground water Lumped Model) is a model developed for modelling linkage between surface and groundwater.

= easy_gw_1d =
This is an easy implementation of the one dimensional groundwater model. The data is passed to the module using the xls file and the output is also written in xls. 

{{{
in_file = '/home/tomer/svn/ambhas/examples/input_easy_gw.xls'
out_file = '/home/tomer/svn/ambhas/examples/output/easy_gw.xls'    figure_dir = '/home/tomer/svn/ambhas-wiki/images/'
foo = gw_model_file(in_file, out_file, figure_dir)
}}}
Each worksheet in the input file is for each of the monitoring well. You can model as many as well you want by providing separate worksheet for them. You can fit the simulated groundwater level with the observed one by modifying the parameters. For the default parameters the output is:

http://ambhas.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/berambadi.png

The output file by the model are provided only for quick comparison. You can use the output xls file to make a better plot for your work.


= errlib =
This provides some simple error indices e.g. rmse, bias, NS coefficient etc.

{{{
#generate two random variable
obs = np.random.normal(size=100)    
sim = np.random.normal(size=100)  
   
# print error indices
print(pc_bias(sim,obs))
print(apb(sim,obs)) 
print(rmse(sim,obs)) 
print(mae(sim,obs)) 
print(bias(sim,obs)) 
print(NS(sim,obs)) 
print(L(sim,obs))
print(correlation(sim,obs))
}}}


= extract gis data =
Useful for extracting data over few locations from multiple gis file.
The script is written to extract the data from multiple points in the monitoring plots and then compute median and std over them. This becomes quiet useful when the shape of the monitoring plots is not regular. For instance see the monitoring plot below:

http://ambhas.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/data_extraction.png

The points are generated at 5 m interval in both (x and y) direction. 
The blue line shows the boundary of the plot. The + marks are the points inside the plot, on which data is extracted.

One example xls file for the monitoring field co-ordinate is given in example directory by the file name "plots_66.xls", which is for the 66 monitoring plots of AMBHAS project. 

Lets say you want to extract the data from all the images inside the directory for these 66 plots. 

{{{
# import required libraries
from ambhas.extract_gis_data import extract_gis
import os

# location of files
in_dir = '/home/tomer/RADARSAT/bc/'
out_file = '/home/tomer/RADARSAT/output/bc.xls'

# get the name of the files in the input directory
# if you want only one file, or some selected files in the directory
# you can provide the name of those files as a list in this variable
in_files = os.listdir(in_dir)
in_files.sort()

# starting letters of the address for the RADARSAT files
ds_in = []
n = len(in_files)
for i in range(n):
    in_file = in_dir + in_files[i]
      
    ds_in.append(in_file)
   
xls_in = '/home/tomer/berambadi/plots_66/plots_66.xls'

    
extract_gis(xls_in, out_file, ds_in, in_files)
}}}
The output will be saved in the out_file (a xls file) defined by you. The columns represents the different images. Row represents the different monitoring plots.

= gis =
Some GIS tool e.g. conversion of coordinate system from latlong to UTM.

==UTM to latlon==
{{{
x = 60000
y = 1200000
lat,lon = utm2deg(x,y,utmzone=43)
}}}

==latlon to UTM ==
{{{
lat = 71
lon = 11
x,y = deg2utm(lat,lon,utmzone=43)
}}}

==Compute the area in square meters given the longitude of the center and size of the grid ==
{{{
lat = 11
size_cell = 0.125
geodetic_area(11,0.5)
}}}
The output is in square meter.

==Length of one degree of latitude and longitude for different latitudes==

{{{
>>> latitude_length(11)
110614.71345469992
>>> longitude_length(11)
109287.5573212734
}}}
Notice that that input is latitudes in both the cases. Closer to the equator the length of one degree of latitude and longitude becomes nearly equal. As you move away form the equator towards the pole, the length of latitude remain nearly same, however the longitude starts decreasing. 

==Read/Write ASCII Grid file==
ASCII/Esri grid file (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esri_grid) is used by various program to write the gis data. 

{{{
fname = '/home/tomer/svn/ambhas/examples/sample_ascii_grid.grd'
data, header = read_ascii_grid(fname)
print data
print header
}}}
The print output is:
{{{
[[  nan   nan    5.    2.]
 [  nan   20.  100.   36.]
 [   3.    8.   35.   10.]
 [  32.   42.   50.    6.]
 [  88.   75.   27.    9.]
 [  13.    5.    1.   nan]]
{'ncols': 4, 'cellsize': 50.0, 'nrows': 6, 'xllcorner': 0.0, 'yllcorner': 0.0, 'NODATA_value': -9999}
}}}

Same way the data can be written in ascii format. The header data (e.g. ncols, cellsize etc.) should be in dictionary format.
{{{
fname = '/home/tomer/svn/ambhas/examples/sample_ascii_grid_out.grd'
write_ascii_grid(fname, data, header)
}}}



= gw =
Groundwater model.

= krige =
Variogram and Kriging analysis.

= radarsat =
Process RADARSAT-2 data.

= rain_disagg =
Rainfall disaggregation model based on the random multiplicative cascade (RMC) approach.

= richards =
This module provides the numerical solution of Richards' equation in python. The description about Richards' equation can be found in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richards_equation]. 

This module reads the input from a xls file, run the module and write the output into netcdf format. The example xls file is given in the examples subdirectory by the name maddur.xls. Lets first plot the rainfall and PET from the input file.
{{{
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from ambhas.xls import xlsread

in_file = 'maddur.xls'
xls_file = xlsread(in_file)
doy = xls_file.get_cells('B2:B366','forcing')
rain = xls_file.get_cells('C2:C366','forcing')
pet = xls_file.get_cells('D2:D366','forcing')

plt.clf()
plt.bar(doy,rain, color='m', edgecolor='m', label='Rainfall')
plt.plot(pet, label='PET')
plt.grid(True)
plt.legend()
plt.xlabel('DOY')
plt.ylabel('mm')
plt.savefig('output/richards_forcing.png')
}}}

The resulted graph is:

Now lets run the model. The input to the model is given via input xls file. A sample input xls file is provided in the examples directory.
