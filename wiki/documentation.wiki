The library has the following sub-libraries.
 * Copula
    This provides access to three copulas, namely, Clayton, Frank and Gumbel. 
 * csglm
    CSGLM (Coupled Surface-Ground water Lumped Model) is a model developed for modelling linkage between surface and groundwater.

 * easy_gw_1d
    This is an easy implementation of the one dimensional groundwater model. This data is pass to the module using the xls file and the output is also written in xls. You need not to know Python for using this module.

 * errlib
    This provides some simple error indices e.g. rmse, bias, NS coefficient etc.

 * extract gis data
    Useful for extracting data over few locations from multiple gis file.

 * gis
    Some GIS tool e.g. conversion of coordinate system from latlong to UTM.

 * gw
   Groundwater model.

 * krige
   Variogram and Kriging analysis.

 * radarsat
   Process RADARSAT-2 data.

 * rain_disagg
   Rainfall disaggregation model based on the random multiplicative cascade (RMC) approach.

 * richards
   Numerical solution of Richards' equation in python.

 * soil_texture
   Provides the soil type and soil hydraulic properties based on pedotransfer function given the percentage of sand, silt and clay.

 * stats
   Some statistical functions

 * sunlib
   Modules to compute sunrise, sunset time etc.

 * xls
  Read and write data to xls files.
